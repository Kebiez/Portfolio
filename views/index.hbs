        <p>
            Hi, my name is Kevin Karlsson and I studied computer engineering at Jönköping University (JU). I'm 22
            years old and been programming since senior high school.
            There I studied something called game programming and I learned the basics of programming and also some
            stuff about HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What do I do now?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Now I work at *enter random company* and am programming websites for a living, on this website you can
            see some projects that I've worked on by just clicking on the tab projects.
            And it you're curious about what I'm doing right now as a project you can look at the blog tab where I
            will post about my current project.
        </p>
